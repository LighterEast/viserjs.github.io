## Installation

We use React version to write install method.

### npm

NPM is the easiest and fastest way to get started using Recharts. It is also the recommended installation method when building single-page applications (SPAs). It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as Webpack.

```shell
# latest stable
$ npm install viser-react
```

### umd

The UMD build is also available on unpkg.com:

```html
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/recharts/umd/viser-react.min.js"></script>
```

Then you can find the library on window.ViserReact.

### dev build

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/viserjs/viser.git
$ cd viser/packages/viser-react
$ npm install
$ cd ../../demo
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
